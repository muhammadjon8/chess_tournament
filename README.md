# How this works
## Participants
First we need to register participants for the tournament.

If the participant already registered for the tournament, then the participant will login to his account

## Admin
Creating tournaments and adding participants and updating participants details and their scores is the task that admins are reponsible for. That's why, admin first login to his account.

There is also one admin who is creator and can add new admins.

## Creating tournament
Next step is to create a tournament which has its name and starting and ending date.

## Adding participants to the tournament
The admin then classiy the participants to the spicific tournament. Just like that:
```
{
    "tournament_id": 3,
    "player_id": 24
}
```

## Start the tournament
After that the admin will start the tournament by this address:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/tournament/3/start
```
Number 3 here is the id of the tournament that plays a key role here.

From now on, the participants will be randomly paired and assigned to the matches table where the round number is 0.
All participants' pairs will be stored to the opponents table in order to make sure that the participants will face the opponent once during the tournament

After all matches finished, admin will update the scores of the players which was initially 0 equally, where the winner gets 10 points and 5 points for both if draw occured.

## Starting rounds
Hence updating the scores after round 0, to start the next round, admin request to this route.

```http://localhost:3000/api/tournament/3/round/1
```
1 here stands for the round number

When clicked this route, the Leaderboard table will be updated automatically and the opponents will be paired regarding their total scores as mentioned in Swiss Chess System.

## Leaderboard
To be up-to-date for the results, you could check the leaderboard where scores displayed in ascending order with high scores.
```http://localhost:3000/api/leaderboard
```

# unit tests
$ npm run test
